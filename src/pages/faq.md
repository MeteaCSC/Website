# FQA

### Q: Are there any requirements to join?

Not at all! Beginners are welcome! However in some sections like competitive programming it is better to join if you are already familiar with a programming language.

### Q: Do I need to commit to every meeting?

No! We understand that there are all sorts of activies going on at the same time as our meetings. It is also fine to join at any time throughout the year.

### Q: Do you guys do anything for computer engineering?

We currently don't, but we would be happy to set something up if people are interested.

### Q: Will I need to bring a laptop?

It largly depends on what you are doing within the club. There are online versions for a lot of software we use (a great example being [replit](https://replit.com/)) which can be accessed on Chromebook, but not everything.
